    Dear Linda Sterling, \\[1em]
    \indent\indent As a Computer-Science Major, I am excited to apply for the Web Developer position for the Sustainability Engagement Institute.
    My current employment with our Ridgeway Dining Hall as a Student Manager has shown me the amount of food waste and work that needs to be done to ensure we keep our practices sustainable.

    \indent\indent Alongside my major-related coursework, I have many projects that I learn from:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Personal website showcasing my basic projects, profile, and other information about me (\href{https://msws.xyz}{msws.xyz}).
        \item Xenforo Forums for the EdgeGamers Community (\href{https://edgegamers.com}{edgegamers.com}).
        \item Grafana statistics tracking (\href{https://msws.xyz/stats}{msws.xyz/stats}).
    \end{itemize}

    With my familiarity in Git (and GitHub + GitLab), dedication to quality clean code, and understanding of the softwares that go into web development,
    I believe I can exceed the requirements laid out for this position. My work experience alongside my years of working with a gaming community has
    shown me how important teamwork and sustainability is.

    I would be thrilled to assist in spreading the importance of sustainability in all areas of our university. I look forward to speaking with you.

    Sincerely, \\
    Isaac Boaz
